# The Science World Solar System

I recently came across [The Sweden Solar System](http://www.swedensolarsystem.se/en/):

> The Sweden Solar System (SSS) is the worldâ€™s largest model of our planetary system. The Sun is represented by the Globe in Stockholm, the largest spherical building in the world, and the planets are lined up in direction north from here.

I live in Vancouver, BC, where the Science World has a geodesic dome as well, so I thought that it would be a great sun as well!

I put together [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRobE-UmoUG7HJi4RN8c_71nXaUoxvd-ZpDwQjnlJqrMIUEr5g_nZfLAMNEdCMhwiOgj1EPc0XQrSMo/pubhtml?gid=625779438&single=true) with planet distance & size in real life and in Science World life.

In `kml.rb`, I re-learned to draw circles, offset coordinates with a distance in meters, and generate a KML file representing the planet orbits.

And here it is on [Google Map](https://www.google.ca/maps/d/viewer?mid=1ibVkcfzDeuIh6zHjZoQP5gZyIcWnlT2q&ll=49.26368798525838%2C-123.13926397657606&z=8)!

I believe that I could use a better formula so that the circles would be more circular (?!) but I'm happy to see that earth orbits just next to where I live!

Contributions are welcomed! And if you'd like to build real (small) planets to scale and disseminate them in Greater Vancouver, go for it!
